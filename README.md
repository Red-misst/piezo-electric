- **5.0-7.2V**: Heavy vehicles (trucks, buses)

The 470µF capacitor provides sufficient energy storage for LED operation while maintaining realistic charge/discharge characteristics for road-based energy harvesting applications.

## 🧪 Technical Details

### Energy Storage Configuration
The system uses a single 470µF capacitor for energy storage:
```
Total Capacitance = 470µF
```

This configuration:
- Provides sufficient energy storage for LED operation
- Enables direct discharge to LED loads
- Simplifies the circuit design

### Energy Calculation
The system uses the following formula to calculate energy stored in the 470µF capacitor:
```
E = 0.5 × C × V²
```
Where:
- E = Energy in joules (J)
- C = Total capacitance in farads (470µF = 0.00047F)
- V = Voltage in volts (ranges from 2.0V to 7.2V)

**Example Calculations:**
- At 2.0V: E = 0.5 × 0.00047 × (2.0)² = 0.00094 J
- At 4.5V: E = 0.5 × 0.00047 × (4.5)² = 0.0048 J  
- At 7.2V: E = 0.5 × 0.00047 × (7.2)² = 0.0122 J

### Runtime Estimation
LED runtime is calculated as:
```
Runtime (seconds) = Energy (J) / Power consumption (W)
```

### Wireless Communication
- **Protocol**: WebSocket for real-time bidirectional communication
- **Data format**: JSON messages containing sensor readings and system status
- **Update frequency**: 2 seconds (configurable)

## 🚗 Vehicle Detection System

The ESP8266 counts vehicles using a sophisticated voltage threshold detection circuit with a zener diode and resistor network. This system provides reliable vehicle counting by detecting voltage spikes generated when vehicles pass over the piezoelectric sensors.

### Car Counting Circuit Design

```
Piezo Sensor → Bridge Rectifier → Zener Diode (3.3V) → ESP8266 ADC
                                        ↓
                                   10kΩ Resistor → GND
```

### How Vehicle Counting Works

1. **Voltage Generation**: When a vehicle passes over the piezoelectric sensor, mechanical pressure generates an electrical voltage spike (typically 2-15V depending on vehicle weight and speed).

2. **Voltage Regulation**: The zener diode (3.3V) acts as a voltage regulator and threshold detector:
   - When voltage exceeds 3.3V, the zener conducts
   - This creates a stable 3.3V signal at the ESP8266's analog input
   - Voltages below 3.3V pass through proportionally

3. **Threshold Detection**: The ESP8266 firmware continuously monitors the analog input (A0):
   ```cpp
   int rawValue = analogRead(A0);
   float voltage = (rawValue / 1024.0) * 3.3;
   
   // Vehicle detected when voltage exceeds threshold
   if (voltage > DETECTION_THRESHOLD && !vehicleDetected) {
       vehicleCount++;
       vehicleDetected = true;
   }
   ```

4. **Debouncing**: A software debounce timer prevents multiple counts from a single vehicle:
   ```cpp
   unsigned long debounceDelay = 2000; // 2 seconds
   if (millis() - lastDetectionTime > debounceDelay) {
       vehicleDetected = false;
   }
   ```

### Circuit Components Explained

- **Zener Diode (3.3V)**: 
  - Protects ESP8266 from voltage spikes
  - Creates consistent voltage levels for reliable detection
  - Acts as a voltage threshold reference

- **10kΩ Pull-down Resistor**:
  - Ensures ADC reads 0V when no vehicle is present
  - Provides current path for zener diode operation
  - Prevents floating input conditions

- **100kΩ Input Protection Resistor**:
  - Limits current into ESP8266 ADC pin
  - Additional protection against voltage spikes
  - Reduces noise in analog readings

### Detection Algorithm

The ESP8266 firmware implements a multi-stage detection algorithm:

1. **Baseline Monitoring**: Continuously sample voltage every 100ms
2. **Spike Detection**: Identify voltage increases above baseline + threshold
3. **Validation**: Confirm spike duration (50-500ms typical for vehicles)
4. **Counting**: Increment counter and start debounce timer
5. **Reset**: Return to baseline monitoring after debounce period

### Calibration and Sensitivity

The system can be calibrated for different vehicle types:

- **Light Vehicles (cars, motorcycles)**: 2.5V threshold
- **Medium Vehicles (SUVs, trucks)**: 2.0V threshold  
- **Heavy Vehicles (buses, semis)**: 1.5V threshold

```cpp
// Firmware configuration
#define LIGHT_VEHICLE_THRESHOLD 2.5
#define MEDIUM_VEHICLE_THRESHOLD 2.0
#define HEAVY_VEHICLE_THRESHOLD 1.5
```

### Advantages of This Design

1. **Reliable Detection**: Zener diode provides consistent voltage reference
2. **Speed Independent**: Works regardless of vehicle speed
3. **Weight Sensitive**: Heavier vehicles generate higher voltages
4. **Low Power**: Only active during vehicle detection events
5. **Simple Circuit**: Minimal components reduce failure points
